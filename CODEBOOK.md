## Project Description
Final project for the 'Getting and Cleaning Data' course as part of the Coursera Data Science Specialization (getdata-013). The purpose of the project is to prepare a tidy, curated dataset from a large repository of human activity tracking data. More information about this dataset is available at the links in the original assignment description in the readme. 
 
##Study design and data processing
 
###Collection of the raw data
*The following description is modified but almost verbatim from the original source (see source section at the end of this document) and all credit goes to the original authors.*

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (Walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, the authors captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Some further information about transformations applied to the data can be found in the variable construction schema later in this document.
 
##Creating the tidy datafile
 
###Guide to create the tidy data file
If you'd like to create the tidy data file yourself, follow these steps: 

1. download the data as a compressed gz file from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). Download the run_analysis.R script.

2. Extract the file. You should now have a folder called UCI HAR Dataset. 

3. Copy the absolute path to that folder and paste it into the *setwd()* command in line 9 of run_analysis.R (I was going to have it prompt the user, but that's annoying)

4. If you don't have it, install the tidyR package in R using the package installer or *install.packages('tidyr')*

5. Run the script by copy pasting, using 'Run' in Rstudio, or using the command *source('path/to/run_analysis.R')*

The tidy data file will be output as tidy_data.txt inside the UCI HAR Dataset folder.
 
###Cleaning of the data
The script performs five main operations:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

More information and justification of design choices is available in [The README](README.md)
 
##Description of the variables in the tidy_data.txt file
The tidy data file is a tab-separated text file that is 180Rx68C. The first two columns denote the subject and activity, making up 180 combinations (30 subjects * 6 activities). The other 66 variables are the arithmetic means of various summary statistics (mean and standard deviation) of activity measurements. Some information used in the variable descriptions comes from the feature_info file included with the original dataset. 

###Variable construction schema
Rather than write out a complete english description for each individual variable, I have here provided a variable construction schema from which one can derive the meaning of every variable. Individual variable details can also be found in the table in the next section.
